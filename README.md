# GeoSpaceMetry

**GeoSpaceMetry** is an experimental 3D scene where geometry expands into space.  
A central text floats in the void, surrounded by simple geometric forms in motion.

This project blends visual minimalism with cosmic vibes, exploring spatial balance and generative 3D elements using modern web tools.
